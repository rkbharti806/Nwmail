<h1>POP and POP3</h1>
      <section>

<p>The first version of the Post Office Protocol was first published in a comment request in 1984 by the Internet Engineering Task Force as RFC 918.Next, developers recognize the need to devise a simple and efficient way to receive email from email servers. After which instead of accessing the mailbox online, they have seen the benefits of offline reading.</p>

<p>In 1985, version 2 of the Post Office Protocol was published in RFC 937, which was replaced with version 3 in 1988 with the publication of RFC 1081.POP3 was revised several times over the next 10 years before being published to the current specification as 1996 RFC 1939.</p>
<p>The POP network protocol underwent many improvements and refinements, but the developers of its POP maintained the core principle of a straightforward protocol, which consists of a three-stage process between email clients and servers during mail retrieval.</p>

  <p>1. Post Office Protocol and POP version-3 is a standerd mail protocol used to receive emails from a remote server to a local email client.</p>
<p>2. POP3 allows you to download email masseges on your local computer and read them even when you are offline.</p>
<p>3. POP3 works on the following two ports by default:-<br>
	  a} port 110: default, non-encrypted port. <br>
      b} port 995: should be used when the user needs to connect using POP3 securely.</p>
